# Pathfinding Visualizer

This is a visualizer based off of Javascript, CSS, and the React library to visualize pathfinding algorithms such as that of A* and Djikstra's.

It's a work in progress, but feel free to check out how it's going at https://patwang123.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/!

# STATUS

As of now, the general interface has been implemented (selecting walls, start node, end node), but the algorithms have not been implemented yet.

# CREDITS

Inspiration of this visualizer is based off of Clement Mihailescu's visualizer: https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/#. All code is written by myself.
