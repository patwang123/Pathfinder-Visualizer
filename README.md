# Pathfinding Visualizer

This is a visualizer based off of Javascript, CSS, and the React library to visualize pathfinding algorithms such as that of A* and Djikstra's (This was a short weekend project, so this is implemented with only basic visualizing tools)

It's a work in progress, but feel free to check out how it's going at https://patwang123.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/!

# Status

As of now, the implementation of it has been finished. This is a pathfinding visualizer with little features. Aside from adding walls, there are no other features (e.g. weights).

# CREDITS

Inspiration of this visualizer is based off of Clement Mihailescu's visualizer: https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/#. All code is written by myself.
